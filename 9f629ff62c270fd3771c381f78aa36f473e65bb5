      "message": "@Victor, the HPA related properties are already defined in R2 DM as well as part of SOL-001. This patch is meant to validate those properties\u0027 key/value pairs. These detailed key/value pairs are not defined by R2/R3 DM, but defined by an additional IFA011 and IFA014 model registry. I think Alex have reached the agreement when defining the R2 DM with modeling subcommittee about this DM/model registry separation.\n\nThis is the technical debt we brought from Beijing release.",
